### Background

{{ BACKGROUND }}

### Requirements

<!-- One R-item per line, exactly `- [ ] R1. <text>` (checkbox + `R<n>.`); `spur task check` flags any other form. Keep empty until requirements are known. -->

### Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Number items AC1, AC2, … (never R<n> — that is the Requirements namespace): `- [ ] AC1 — <feature scenario title without its R-number>` bullets or `Scenario: AC1 — <title>` blocks; add `(req: R<n>)` to bind a task requirement; task-only checks go in prose below, or set `ac_altitude: task-local`. Keep empty if this task has no objective AC yet. -->

### Q&A

<!-- CLOSED decisions from refinement: what was chosen and why, what was deferred and on what
     condition. Not a parking lot for open questions — an unanswered question here means the task
     is not ready to hand off. Keep empty if none. -->

### Design

<!-- Chosen approach, key tradeoffs, invariants, and impacted surfaces. Keep snippets short. -->

### Plan

<!-- Ordered implementation checklist. Fill before moving to todo/wip. -->

### Solution

<!-- Filled during implementation: file:line change map and concise rationale. -->

### Testing

<!-- Filled during verification: commands run, outcomes, coverage claim or N/A. -->

### Review

<!-- Filled during review: P1-P4 findings, residual risk, and final disposition. -->

### References

<!-- Links to features, docs, ADRs, related tasks, or external references. -->
